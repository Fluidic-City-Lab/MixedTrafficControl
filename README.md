## Setup with Docker 
### Requirements
    docker
    nvidia-docker
    Ubuntu

Install docker on your version of Ubuntu by following the instructions provided [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/).
Follow the steps under the heading "Install using the Apt repository."

Install nvidia-docker on your version of Ubuntu by following the instructions provided [here](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/install-guide.html).
Follow the steps under the headings "Installing with Apt" and "Configuring Docker."

### Download Docker image
    docker pull wangdawei1996/ray_sumo:beta5

### Run docker container
    docker run -it \
        -p 0.0.0.0:6006:6006 \
        --gpus all \
        --shm-size=10.01gb \
        wangdawei1996/ray_sumo:beta5 bash

## Setup with Anaconda (recommended)
### Install SUMO
Please follow the official instructions provided [here](https://sumo.dlr.de/docs/Installing/index.html).
It should involve just running the following command:
```
sudo apt-get install sumo sumo-tools sumo-doc
```
We recommend SUMO v1.12.0

### Setup Conda environment
    conda create --name MixedTrafficControl python=3.7
    conda activate MixedTrafficControl
    pip install -r requirements.txt

## Training
    
To train a model, an example command is the following:
```
python DQN_run.py --rv-rate 1.0 --stop-iters 1000 --framework torch --num-cpu 16
```       

Depending on your CPU, you may need to lower num-cpu to a smaller value. The rv-rate value can be anything between 0 to 1.0. Tensorflow 1 and Tensorflow 2 can be selected as the framework by providing "tf" or "tf2", respectively, as the framework; however, we recommend using torch (PyTorch) as the framework.

For reference, an example reward curve after training using the above command should look like:
![reward_curve](img/reward_curve.png)

## Evaluation
To evaluate a trained model, an example command is the following:
```
python DQN_eval.py --rv-rate 1.0 --model-dir /path/to/model --save-dir /path/to/save/folder --stop-timesteps 1000
```

The rv-rate should match the rv-rate provided in the training command. The model-dir value should direct to the specific checkpoint number that you want to evaluate. The save-dir should direct to the folder/directory where you want to save the evaluation results.

A more filled-out example command is the following:
```
python DQN_eval.py --rv-rate 1.0 --model-dir /home/*username*/ray_results/DQN_RV*rv-rate*/*trial-name*/*checkpoint_number* --save-dir /home/*username*/*evaluation-dir* --stop-timesteps 1000
```

Both paths provided are absolute paths, but they could also be relative paths. Absolute paths are provided to avoid any assumptions on the current working directory. Any value between *'s needs to provided. Note: *trial-name* is typically a long string, so we recommend renaming it to something more meaningful. The format of *checkpoint_number* is something like "checkpoint_00770" or "checkpoint_001000"; however, we also recommend saving the checkpoint name as something more meaningful depending on what metric you're observing.


## Tensorboard
You can track training or view the results of training by using tensorboard.
```
tensorboard --logdir /path/to/ray_results/folder
```

There are numerous metrics that are saved during training so you may have to click through the "Previous" and "Next" buttons to find a metric of interest.

Most likely, the command for starting Tensorboard will look like (assuming you've opened a fresh terminal interface in Ubuntu):
```
tensorboard --logdir ray_results/DQN_RV*rv-rate*/
```

The "rv_rate" portion of the above command should be replaced with whatever RV penetration rate you want to observe.
